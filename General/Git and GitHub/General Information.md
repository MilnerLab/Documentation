# Git and GitHub – A Brief Overview

## What Is Git?

Git is a **version control system**.  
It helps you:

- Track changes to files over time  
- Go back to earlier versions if something breaks  
- Work on the same project in parallel with others

With Git, your project history is stored as a series of snapshots, so you can see what changed, when it changed, and who changed it.

## What Is GitHub?

GitHub is an **online platform** built around Git.  
It provides a place to:

- Store Git repositories in the cloud  
- Share code with other people  
- Collaborate on projects from anywhere

GitHub is not Git itself; it is a service that hosts Git repositories and adds social and collaboration features around them.

## What Are They Used For?

Together, Git and GitHub are commonly used to:

- Manage the history of a project’s files  
- Experiment safely with new ideas without losing the existing work  
- Collaborate with teammates on the same codebase  
- Share projects publicly or keep them private within a team or organization

In short, **Git** handles version control on your machine, and **GitHub** provides a shared online space where Git-based projects can live and be worked on together.
