# VS Code Workspace (`*.code-workspace`)

Some projects include a `*.code-workspace` file, for example:

- `Lab_Apps.code-workspace`

This file contains:

- Which folder(s) to open in VS Code
- Workspace-specific settings
- Recommended extensions for this workspace

## How to use it

Instead of opening the folder directly, **open the workspace file**:

- From VS Code:  
  `File → Open Workspace from File...` → select `*.code-workspace`
- Or double-click the `*.code-workspace` file from your file explorer

> **Recommendation:** If a workspace file exists, always use it.  
> It ensures VS Code has the correct settings for this project.
