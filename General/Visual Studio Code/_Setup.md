# VS Code Setup & Cloning a GitHub Repository
---
## 1. Install VS Code

1. Go to the official website: https://code.visualstudio.com
2. Download the installer for your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the setup steps.
4. Start **Visual Studio Code**.

## 2. Extensions

VS Code extensions are small add-ons that extend the functionality of Visual Studio Code.

They can:
- add support for new **languages** (syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, formatting)
- integrate **tools** (Git, Docker, testing frameworks, CI/CD, etc.)
- improve **productivity** (snippets, code completion, refactoring helpers)
- customize the **editor** (themes, icons, UI tweaks)

Open the **Extensions** view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`) and install.

In our projects you can find `_extensions.txt` that notes down the proposed extensions for this repo.
